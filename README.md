How boring is it to spend hours searching for new job positions? Can't you think of anything better to do? ME TOO! I'm presenting easy to use app which will do all the dirty job searching work for you, while you spend your time editing your CV or enjoying a good healthy sleep...:wink:
## Technologies
 -   Python (including packages BeautifulSoup from bs4, requests, Flask, Jinja2, psycopg2, mysql-connector-python etc)
 -   MySQL and PostgreSQL
 - Docker

## Description :pencil:
The purpose of this project is to make job search easier. 
What I've done already:
 - Created python script that checks for adverts of Cloud Developer positions and stocks them in Azure's PostgreSQL
 - Separate module that deletes the duplicates from DB, gets the updates within last 12 hours and sends emails containing new annonces. 

## Next step :pencil2:

 - [ ] Creating stylish HTML page (using CSS and JS)
 - [ ] Writing tests to make sure that code is stable and doesn what it has to
 - [ ] Adding more search options, job names, regions, possibly other webpages
 - [ ] Easy installation (bash script? Ansible? I don't know yet)
 
 ## Installation :computer:
The project is still being developed at the moment, and changes are coming all the time.
More info coming up very soon...
